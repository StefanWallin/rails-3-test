Rails 3 Lab
===========

WTF is this?
------------

This is one of those super simple task management applications. 

Just clone the repo, cd into tasks and run:
  rails s

and you will have a tasks managment application on http://localhost:3000.

Caveats
-------
Based on how rails 3 works with unobtrusive JS, the app wont work without javascript enabled. Which sucks heavily. I know I can fix it, but I haven't bothered, yet...
